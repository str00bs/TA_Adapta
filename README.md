# üöÄ Technical Assignment - Adapta
This repository contains three separate solutions for a technical assignment, divided by branch.


## üëã Welcome!
I have intentionally "overdone" this assignment with explicit intent & purpose of showing how a more modern web-framework ([FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/))
can be better fit for the intended purpose (i.e. services/micro-services) than Django, which may be better suited for monolithic applications. 
It should also be mentioned, that it has *significantly* more throughput (higher [RPS](https://www.toucantoco.com/en/glossary/requests-per-second)), and faster response times.

‚ùó Please note, each solution has it's own `README.md` file with information specific to that branch and solution.
